      <p><strong>kontemplate</strong> is a tool for templating Kubernetes cluster resources for different environments. It supports expressive templates and simple per-environment configuration files, but also scales to more complex use-cases by making advanced features usable incrementally.</p>

      <p>Many tools exist in this space, most notably <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a>, but often they come with complexity and overhead that is not required in simple scenarios. Kontemplate attempts to do only what the user expects, requires no moving components in the clusters and is easy to understand and get started with.</p>

      <p>Despite being implemented in Go, kontemplate has proven stable in several production deployments.</p>
